            <h1>How I am blogging</h1>

            <p>
                I've consistently tried to keep my computing life incredibly simple: few devices, few configurations. I
                don't even have a <code>dotfile</code>s repository or anything. I use the defaults for everything.

            <p> I really don't want to be fiddling with computers more than I have to. For the past three or so years
                I've
                never even bothered with tweaking a Linux distro or whatever for my computing needs: MacOS is Unix after
                all.

                For blogging, I even used Google sites because I was too lazy to setup a domain and write DNS records.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation has boiled over now that I actually have to manage some complexity, and I decided to
                revamp my digital footprint and some of the infrastructure that I have at home. Starting with a domain
                name and a proper blog.
            </p>
            <p>
                This blog is written on HTML and it feels nostalgic - the last time I wrote "proper" HTML was when I was
                barely a teenager, incidentally also hosting websites. It's not pure as I use some javascript - that I
                don't maintain - but import from the web, for \(\LaTeX\) and custom font support, for example. But
                overall, you download an HTML page and read the website. It's quite fast and infinitely portable!
            </p>
            <p>
                I tried using static website generators like Jekyll and I think I'm too dumb for them. It's too
                abstracted. It's HTML after all, why do I need it to be generated from markdown? Maybe I'm getting old.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyway, it's very simple: I write HTML and push it to a GitHub repo. This repo builds a bundle with my
                HTML
                files using the official GitHub pages actions, like this:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-yaml code-block">
                - name: Checkout
                  uses: actions/checkout@v4
                - name: Setup Pages
                  uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
                - name: Upload artifact
                  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
                  with:
                    path: '.'
                - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
                  id: deployment
                  uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
                </code></pre>


            <p> It's beautiful because I don't have to worry about anything other than writing HTML. Other than that, I
                also setup a domain name with OVH and configured the <a
                    href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">DNS
                    records</a> to make my domain point to the default
                <code>{username}.github.io</username></code> url.
            </p>

            <p>Your GitHub repository, hosting the files, should specifically also have the same names as the url, like
                <a
                    href="https://github.com/leonardoheld/leonardoheld.github.io">github.com/leonardoheld/leonardoheld.github.io</a>,
                otherwise it doesn't work, so this
                website is also accessible via
                <code>leonardoheld.github.io</code>
            </p>

            <p>
                To write the HTML, I use Visual Studio Code with the default HTML formatter and use the
                <code>open</code> utility
                from MacOS to render it on my browser. I think sometime in the future I'll have a script with
                <code>inotify</code><a href="#footnote-1">[0]</a> so I don't have to âŒ˜ + R every time I got to the
                browser, but even that is rare; I
                only had to do a bit of setup to have a <a href="template.html">template file</a>, which I copy every
                time I want to create a new post.
            <p>
                On the matter of using some paid hosting service: because of HTML, I'm not bound to a particular format
                or a peculiar
                deployment - if Microsoft decides to kick me out, I'll spin a web server in a matter of minutes from my
                home.
            </p>

            <p>And as some very smart person once said "this is a website, which means it sometimes goes offline".</p>
            </p>

            <p id="footnote-1">[0] I'm not using the amazing <a
                    href="https://github.com/ritwickdey/vscode-live-server">LiveServer</a> extension
                from Mr. Ritwick Dey</p>
