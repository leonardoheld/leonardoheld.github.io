                I've watched this amazing good video-essay by Sarah Davis Baker. It puts into words that feeling that we
                lost when we moved to the "new internet", which is the soul-lacking, algorithmically-driven internet we
                have today in counterpart to the internet of the late 90s and early 2000s, which I assure you was truly
                personal, authentic and best of all: not ubiquitous.

        <p>Another great video I saw this week was an almost two-hour-long compilation about the life and historical
            events of each and every Pope. I'm sure as you all know Pope Francis just died and it's very interestign to
            look back at how the papacy has been an active player in world history and politics since even before
            <i>catholicism</i> was a word. Worth the watch, albeit very concise, due to time constraints, I assume.

        <h2>Reading</h2>
        <p>
            For my reading, I recommend following this hyperlink to Uros Popovic's <a
                href="https://popovicu.com/posts/bare-metal-printf/">Bare metal printf - C standard library without
                OS</a>. It's nothing super new for me as I've significantly dabbled into microcontrollers before, but
            it's a
            nice refresher. The target for the <code>printf</code> function is the UART16550 connected to an emulated
            riscv64 machine.

        <h2>Listening</h2>

        <p>KEXP has a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md4yIaUa7uA">AURORA performance</a> up on their
            channel which has been on repeat for the past two months. It's pretty amazing to see how her vocal range has
            evolved over the years. I'm a bit biased about her earlier stuff, but she manages to always impress.</p>
